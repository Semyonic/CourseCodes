## COMP-412 : Parsing, Compiling and Interpreting

The implementation of compilers has enabled the production of increasingly large computer systems. Compilers and assemblers play a crucial role and at the same time are good examples of large and complex programs that have at least in part a sound mathematical basis for the way they work. This course studies the different phases of compiler construction and engineering and scientific issue in each stage.
