## COMP-231 : Data Structures and Algorithms I

This course covers the basic science behind the use of computers to provide effective and efficient methods for 
carrying out tasks. Tasks examined include data storage and retrieval, sorting and searching, semi-numerical tasks 
such as encryption, planning and optimization tasks, problems, space searches and games playing. To carry out these 
tasks, both algorithms and structures for the storage of data need to be specified. Mathematical tools have to be 
developed that enable us to measure the fundamental effectiveness of algorithms and in particular the way these 
algorithms scale as the size of the task being performed increases. This course introduces the basic sorting and 
searching methods and dynamic data structures such as linked lists, trees and hash tables.
