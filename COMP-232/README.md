## COMP-232 : Data Structures and Algorithms II

This course builds on COMP-231 to apply similar techniques to analyse more sophisticated algorithms and data 
structures. Topics covered include graphs and graph algorithms, greedy algorithms, random algorithms, 
divide and conquer algorithms, dynamic programming and string searching algorithms.
